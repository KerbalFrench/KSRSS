		// Body descriptions
		#LOC_KSRSS_Ceres_desc = Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt, holding about a third of the Asteroid Belts mass. It  was the first thing in the Asteroid Belt discovered, and it is so large that it is spherical. It is classified as a Dwarf Planet, and is only a bit smaller than Pluto. It is currently orbited by the Dawn Probe.
		#LOC_KSRSS_67P_desc = 67P/Churyumovâ€“Gerasimenko is a periodic comet in the solar system named after its discoverers. "Tchouri" was the destination of the European Space Agency's Rosetta probe, which was launched on March 2, 2004 on board an Ariane 5G+.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Halley_desc = 1P/Halley is a short-period comet visible from Earth every 75 or 76 years, the only one known to be visible from Earth in the naked eye. Last seen : 1986.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Earth_desc = The Pale Blue Dot, home to over seven-billion humans and trillions of other life-forms of various shapes and sizes. Earth is where you are in our neighbourhood, our home. For now, it is our very only place in the vast expanse of our marvellous universe.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Moon_desc = The Moon is Earth's only satellite, a large, gray, and rather barren rock. It is the only other body besides Earth that humans have stepped on and, briefly, called home.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Jupiter_desc = The largest planet in our solar system, the gas giant Jupiter. This planet alone is two and a half times the mass of all of the other planets in the Solar System combined. Made up largely of hydrogen and helium with a relatively mysterious rocky core of heavy elements, Jupiter bears a unique and beautiful cosmic painting of various layers with a prominent and awe-inspiring storm that is said to have existed possibly over three-centuries. Jupiter has at least sixty-seven moons counting the four large "Galilean Moons", one of which has a greater diameter than the first planet Mercury.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Callisto_desc = The fourth of the Galilean moons, Callisto is the second-largest moon in the Jovian system. Callisto has a very thin atmosphere comprised mostly of carbon dioxide and has a rather intense ionosphere.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Ganymede_desc = The largest moon in our Solar System, Ganymede is the third Galilean moon around Jupiter. Ganymede has a liquid iron core which produces a unique, yet meager, magnetosphere.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Io_desc = The closest Galilean moon to Jupiter, and the fourth-largest moon in our Solar System, Io, like all other Galilean moons, was named after one of Zeus's lovers. Io is the most active body in the Solar System geologically which produces an effect on the other moons in Jupiter's grasp. There have been observations of large eruptions that are estimated to rise up to five-hundred-kilometers. Io is made up of silicate rock with an iron sulfide core which can give it the distinctive look achieved by plains coated in sulfur and sulfur dioxide.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Europa_desc = The smallest of the four Galilean moons but only slightly smaller than our Moon, Europa is a rocky moon with a surface mostly made up of water ice. It is believed that under this icy surface a water ocean exists, possibly holding life within the depths.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Mars_desc = The red planet. Named after the Roman god of war, Mars is the fourth planet, and the second smallest in our solar system. Its reddish appearance is due to the presence of large amounts of iron oxide on its surface. Mars has a very thin atmosphere and has many craters that resemble our own Moon. Mars also has the second highest known mountain in our solar system with the famous Olympus Mons at 21,229 meters.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Phobos_desc = One of two natural satellites orbiting Mars, Phobos is named after the Greek god which was depicted as the embodiment of horror. Phobos is the larger and closer natural body around Mars.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Deimos_desc = The second natural satellite around Mars, Deimos is named after Phobos' twin brother, said to personify terror.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Mercury_desc = The first planet in our neighborhood. Mercury is the smallest and fastest of the planets in the solar system. From Earth you may be able to see this planet in the early morning or evening. With temperatures varying from very hot to very cold, this planet is not one that you would want to be on for very long.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Neptune_desc = Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the gaseous planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Triton_desc = The largest satellite around Neptune, Triton is unique among all large moons in the Solar System for its retrograde orbit around its planet.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Pluto_desc = Recently removed from the planetary list, Pluto has been dubbed a "minor-planet". It is the largest object in the Kuiper belt second most massive known dwarf planet. Pluto is mostly comprised of rock and ice and is quite small.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Charon_desc = Charon is the largest of Pluto's moons, and is mutually gravitationally locked with it, so each keeps the same face towards the other.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Ryugu_desc = 162173 Ryugu is a near-Earth object and a potentially hazardous asteroid of the apollo group.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Saturn_desc = The sixth planet in our neighborhood, Saturn is named after the Roman god of Agriculture and is a gas giant with a unique ring surrounding it. Under the gassy layer composed largely of hydrogen, there is a rocky core with a very hot interior.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Dione_desc = Dione is the 15th largest moon in the Solar System, and is more massive than all known moons smaller than itself combined, first discovered in 1684 by Giovanni Cassini.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Iapetus_desc = Iapetus is the furthest large regular moon in Saturn's system, usually inclined, making Saturn's rings visible from the moon's surface, with a large ridgeline along it's equator, giving this moon a curious, walnut like shape.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Mimas_desc = Mimas, not Minmas, is the closest regular moon to Saturn, and the smallest body to keep a spherical shape in the solar system. It definitely isn't the Death Star.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Rhea_desc = Rhea is the second-largest moon of Saturn and the ninth-largest moon in the Solar System. It is the smallest body in the Solar System confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Tethys_desc = Tethys is an icy body, similar in nature to Dione and Rhea. Its density, equal to that of water, indicates that it is mainly composed of ice. It owes its name to the titan Tethys from Greek mythology.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Enceladus_desc = Enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn, covered by fresh, clean ice and the surface temperature at noon only reaches 75 K.  Its notable features include water-rich plumes venting from cryovolanoes the south polar region.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Titan_desc = Titan is the largest moon of Saturn. It is the only natural satellite known to have a dense atmosphere, and the only object other than Earth where clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Uranus_desc = The seventh planet in our neighborhood, Uranus, named after the Greek god of the sky, is similar to the relatively nearby planet Neptune. Uranus is sometimes placed in a category separate from gas giants, known as "Ice Giants". Having a similar atmosphere to Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus is different from the two gas giants in that it contains more water, ammonia and methane. It also has the coldest planetary atmosphere, somewhere around 49K.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Titania_desc = Titania is the largest of the moons of Uranus and the eighth largest moon in the Solar System at a diameter of 1,578 kilometres (981 mi). Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Titania is named after the queen of the fairies in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies inside Uranus's magnetosphere.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Venus_desc = This beautiful object is the second planet of our neighborhood. Named after the goddess of love and beauty, Venus is one of the brightest objects in our night sky. Though she is considered a sister planet to Earth, Venus has no satellites (moons) and is alone in her orbit around our star.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Vesta_desc = Vesta is the second-most-massive and second-largest body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet Ceres, and it contributes an estimated 9% of the mass of the asteroid belt. It is slightly larger than Pallas, though significantly more massive. Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howarditeâ€“eucriteâ€“diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Sun_desc = The Sun, a G2V main sequence yellow dwarf.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Miranda_desc = Miranda or Uranus V is the smallest and innermost of Uranus's five round satellites. Like the other large moons of Uranus, Miranda orbits close to its planet's equatorial plane. At just 44 km in diameter, Miranda is one of the smallest objects in the Solar System known to be spherical under its own gravity. Of the bodies that are known to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, only Saturn's moon Mimas is smaller.
		#LOC_KSRSS_Ariel_desc = Ariel is the fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of Uranus. Ariel orbits and rotates in the equatorial plane of Uranus, which is almost perpendicular to the orbit of Uranus, and so has an extreme seasonal cycle.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_MarsInSpaceHigh = Mars, the Red Planet. You can see Phobos and Deimos out the window.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_PhobosSrfLanded = Mars is huge in the sky.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_PhobosInSpace = This place would be a brilliant mining moon if it weren't for the fact that it is currently falling into Mars.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_DeimosSrfLanded = You're not entirely certain that you're not still in freefall.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_DeimosInSpace = "Have *you* ever fell around a mountain before?" That is your new comeback to anything ever.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_CeresInSpace = Strange white spots. Ice, aliens, or minerals?

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_VestaInSpace = The asteroid is so close to being an Oblate Spheroid that you feel like it should be a dwarf planet. You then remember what it's diameter is, and retract your opinion.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_CallistoInSpace = That's a LOT of craters. It may very well be the most cratered moon in the entire solar system. You look at your Encyclopedia Galactica. It says that it is in fact the most cratered moon in the Solar System.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_CallistoSrfLaned = Callisto must feel really left out, not being involved in the 1:2:4 resonance that Io, Europa, and Ganymede have.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_TethysInSpace = An uninteresting, basic, white moon. Just like your cousin, except for the moon part. You know the one. The one who hangs out at Starbucks and uses hashtags too much. Everyone has that one cousin. Or friend, or significant other, or sibling. The point is, Thethys is the moon equivalent of whoever that person is.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_RheaInSpace = The second largest Saturnian moon is slightly more interesting in its terrain than the other boring white moons.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_IapetusInSpace = The equatorial ridge is quite strange. Perhaps Iapetus was created in a huge planet making mould? Or maybe it's a ring system that fell down over time. Whatever the asnwer is, it's certainly a distinctive feature.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_TitanInSpaceHigh = From the distance, Titan seems to be a fuzzy orange sphere.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_TitanInSpaceLow = Titan seems to have been aptly named. It's quite large by Moon standards.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_TitanFlyingHigh = Atmospheric entry here is calm and sedate, considering the thick atmosphere and the low velocity.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_TitanFlyingLow = There's so much air density here you could probably fly a brick, so your spacecraft flies quite nicely.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_TitaniaInSpace = Uranus looks good from here.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_MirandaInSpace = Wow. That's some weird terrain. It would be so fun to go down there.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_ArielInSpace = Some more severly cracked terrain here. A very interesting looking moon. Uranus' moons have a lot of cracks.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_PlutoInSpace3 = You don't care if it's a planet or a dwarf planet. People are always too caught up about Pluto's planethood, so they never get around to looking at how cool it is.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_PlutoInSpace4 = Pluto loves you. You can tell, can't you?
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_PlutoInSpace5 = Charon looks particularly lovely this time of year.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_CrewReport_PlutoSrfLanded1 = "It's not a real planet" they said in kindergarden. Well here you are, pushing the limits of the human lifespan, just so that you can rub this acheivement in little Bobby Tables' face!

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_EVAReport_EarthInSpace3 = Your jetpack responds well to tiny bursts of thrust. Longer burns make this space suit difficult to control.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_EVAReport_MoonSrfLanded3 = You search the sky for the Earth. You feel small.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_EVAReport_MoonSrfLanded4 = You look down at your boots, and see the footprint. It's remarkably well held-together.
        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_EVAReport_MoonSrfLandedFarSideBasin = You can't see the Earth at all. It's kind of eerie that your only connection to Earth is indirect satellite links.

Saint Peter told them that the kind of vehicle they would drive in heaven depended on how they lived their life.\nHe told the first man he would have a Cadillac because he lived a good life and never cheated on his wife.\nHe told the second he would have a motorcycle because he only cheated on his wife once and he regretted it.\nThen he told the third guy he would have a bicycle because he cheated on his wife alot.\nWell, two years later, the man on the bicycle spotted the man in the Cadillac crying.\nHe asked why he is crying since he had such a nice car and the man replied, "I just saw my wife go by on a skateboard!"

		#LOC_KSRSS_Science_EVAReport_JunoSrfLanded = Nothing cool's going on here, so here's a joke: Why is a fire engine red ?\nBecause a fire engine has four wheels and eight men. Four and eight are twelve. There are twelve inches in a ruler. Queen Elizabeth was a ruler. Queen Elizabeth was also a ship. A ship sails on the ocean. The ocean is made of water. Fish live in water. The Chinese are noted for eating a lot of fish. The Chinese are called red. So therefore, a fire engine is red.

        #LOC_KSRSS_Science_EVAReport_IoSrfLanded2 = The geiger counter in your suit is clicking a lot. This is probably a bad thing.

Now if only you could find your false teeth you could tell mission control about how in your day, pilots had to navigate manually. At that point the young men and women at mission control will sigh, and you will tell them that they should respect you.
